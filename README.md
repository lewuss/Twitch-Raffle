# Twitch-Raffle

Program created with python and tkinter made to carry out twitch raffles. When launched it caches chatters of a twitch channel stored in a variable CHANNEL and then picks a random chatter as a winner. This method has it downsides as it has a probability of picking a viewer that's innactive, however for bigger streamers comes in handy as it doesn't require unnecessary !join spam in chat.
